# Crypto_Trading_Analysis
This repo goes over an Imperial College London Data Science Challenge found here: https://github.com/Imperial-College-Data-Science-Society/Challenges/tree/master/cryptocurrency-trading

You will find my attempt at the problem - Please note that this is an ongoing project which I review monthly. Feel free to have a go and contact me as to the solution you have come up with.

For general purposes I will provide a brief description as to the data below
# Background
Financial markets are often modelled as regression problems. The most unpredictable movements were those of cryptocurrencies. Can you predict their future values?

# The Dataset
This dataset contains data for 4 cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin-Cash) over a 5 year period 2013-2018. Provided data is all in $USD and includes open/close, high/low, volume traded, spread and close ratio. Close ratio is defined as:

Close Ratio = (Close - Low)/(High - Low)
The dataset is provided in a simple .csv file. It is recommended to use the Python packages numpy and pandas to read and manipulate the data. Choice of programming language is not restricted, however Imperial Strategics & Data Science Society projects/workshops are in Python.
